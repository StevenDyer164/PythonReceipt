<h1>ENGI 1020 Receipt Assignment (Python)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of simple lists and while loops in Python that will ask the user for purchased items, the prices, and which items were taxed. It will print these out in a format similar to a receipt detailing your purchase on a piece of thermal paper, including the subtotal, tax (based on Newfoundland tax percentages), and total cost.
